    Added Dashboard Functionality, created skeleton code for pages
    
    + Added left side navigation bar to the Dashboard page which can be pulled in and out with the top button to show just the icons, or the icons as well as short descriptions such as where the icon leads you to
    + Added Sidebar and SidebarEntry component to easily add tabs with a description as well as an icon to the navigation bar. The icons can be clicked to do many things such as log out the user, open/close the nav bar, or even set the dashboard pages content (the right side) to another page (such as Events, Profile, and Create Event pages)
    + The SidebarEntry component is easily reusable to link several different pages of content to the dashboard page
    + Using the SidebarEntry component as well as skeleton code provided in /dashboard/pages, we can easily create pages for our functions such as view profile, create event, etc
    + Added css/styling for the nav bar components and hover/click effects on the icons/descriptions
    + Created skeleton code classes for different pages on the dashboard in /dashboard/pages
    + Modified registration page css to remove the text cursor and user-select abilities. Also smoothed it out and messaed with padding/margin. Added min-size so that the registration component cant get smaller than the text inside of it.

    Refactoring, fixed small bug with error messages
    
    - Refactored some reducer/action names to be more appropriate to what the actions actually do. GET_ERRORS action is now called SET_ERRORS because in the action you are setting the error object to a new one, not retrieving it. Also renamed errorReducer to authErrorReducer to denote the fact that it only has to do with authentication (registration/login) errors. In the future we will probably have more error reducers for different types of errors
    - Added utility function 'clearAuthErrors' to fix a bug where the errors carry over from the registration page to the login page. For example if the user entered a username that already exists in the registration page then fixes their error and presses register, the login page will still display 'Account name already exists' when they first get to the page. To fix this, the utility function is called upon mounting of the registration and login components
    - Code cleanup
