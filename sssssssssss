    Added barebones (but functional) Profile Page
    
    - No Real GUI yet
    + Displays fullName, username, email of user profile from database
    + The labels can be clicked on to edit them, and it will update the database when they press the checkbox or the enter key
    - So far, only full name and email can be changed. I plan on doing the username functionality soon but the MongoDB query for it is a little more complex
    + I plan on creating the UI for it soon but right now it completes its purpose of doing the "view profile" and "edit profile" functions
    + View Profile / Edit Profile functions are now fully connected from front end to back end

    Completed main functionality for 'create events' function from front end to back end
    
    We still have things we need to work on, such as displaying the rest of the errors from the server side, and not allowing the form to be submitted until the inputs are valid on the client side
    + Added eventController to the server
    + Added eventRoute to the server
    : Renamed 'userController' and 'userRoute' to 'authController' and 'authRoute' because they only dealt with register/login functions
    + Added EventSchema to the MongoDB database (one -> many relationship between Users and Events)

    Added Dashboard Functionality, created skeleton code for pages
    
    + Added left side navigation bar to the Dashboard page which can be pulled in and out with the top button to show just the icons, or the icons as well as short descriptions such as where the icon leads you to
    + Added Sidebar and SidebarEntry component to easily add tabs with a description as well as an icon to the navigation bar. The icons can be clicked to do many things such as log out the user, open/close the nav bar, or even set the dashboard pages content (the right side) to another page (such as Events, Profile, and Create Event pages)
    + The SidebarEntry component is easily reusable to link several different pages of content to the dashboard page
    + Using the SidebarEntry component as well as skeleton code provided in /dashboard/pages, we can easily create pages for our functions such as view profile, create event, etc
    + Added css/styling for the nav bar components and hover/click effects on the icons/descriptions
    + Created skeleton code classes for different pages on the dashboard in /dashboard/pages
    + Modified registration page css to remove the text cursor and user-select abilities. Also smoothed it out and messaed with padding/margin. Added min-size so that the registration component cant get smaller than the text inside of it.

    Refactoring, fixed small bug with error messages
    
    - Refactored some reducer/action names to be more appropriate to what the actions actually do. GET_ERRORS action is now called SET_ERRORS because in the action you are setting the error object to a new one, not retrieving it. Also renamed errorReducer to authErrorReducer to denote the fact that it only has to do with authentication (registration/login) errors. In the future we will probably have more error reducers for different types of errors
    - Added utility function 'clearAuthErrors' to fix a bug where the errors carry over from the registration page to the login page. For example if the user entered a username that already exists in the registration page then fixes their error and presses register, the login page will still display 'Account name already exists' when they first get to the page. To fix this, the utility function is called upon mounting of the registration and login components
    - Code cleanup
